    "In this homework you will be working on an open-ended mini-project, where you will put all the different things you have learned so far together to solve an interesting problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few notes and tips when you work on this mini-project: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tips\n",
    "1. This mini-project is open-ended, and while working on it, there might be some situations where you'll have to use your own judgment and make your own decisions (as you would be doing when you work as a data scientist). Make sure you explain your decisions whenever necessary. \n",
    "2. **Do not include everything you ever tried in your submission** -- it's fine just to have your final code. That said, your code should be reproducible and well-documented. For example, if you chose your hyperparameters based on some hyperparameter optimization experiment, you should leave in the code for that experiment so that someone else could re-run it and obtain the same hyperparameters, rather than mysteriously just setting the hyperparameters to some (carefully chosen) values in your code. \n",
    "3. If you realize that you are repeating a lot of code try to organize it in functions. Clear presentation of your code, experiments, and results is the key to be successful in this lab. You may use code from lecture notes or previous lab solutions with appropriate attributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Assessment\n",
    "We plan to grade fairly and leniently. We don't have some secret target score that you need to achieve to get a good grade. **You'll be assessed on demonstration of mastery of course topics, clear presentation, and the quality of your analysis and results.** For example, if you just have a bunch of code and no text or figures, that's not good. If you do a bunch of sane things and get a lower accuracy than your friend, don't sweat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A final note\n",
    "Finally, this style of this \"project\" question is different from other assignments. It'll be up to you to decide when you're \"done\" -- in fact, this is one of the hardest parts of real projects. But please don't spend WAY too much time on this... perhaps \"a few hours\" (15-20 hours???) is a good guideline for this project . Of course if you're having fun you're welcome to spend as much time as you want! But, if so, try not to do it out of perfectionism or getting the best possible grade. Do it because you're learning and enjoying it. Students from the past cohorts have found such kind of labs useful and fun and I hope you enjoy it as well. "

    "\n",
    "### Option 1\n",
    "You can choose to work on a classification problem of predicting whether a credit card client will default or not. \n",
    "For this problem, you will use [Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset). In this data set, there are 30,000 examples and 24 features, and the goal is to estimate whether a person will default (fail to pay) their credit card bills; this column is labeled \"default.payment.next.month\" in the data. The rest of the columns can be used as features. You may take some ideas and compare your results with [the associated research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417407006719), which is available through [the UBC library](https://www.library.ubc.ca/). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2\n",
    "You can choose to work on a regression problem using a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) of New York City Airbnb listings from 2019. As usual, you'll need to start by downloading the dataset, then you will try to predict `reviews_per_month`, as a proxy for the popularity of the listing. Airbnb could use this sort of model to predict how popular future listings might be before they are posted, perhaps to help guide hosts create more appealing listings. In reality they might instead use something like vacancy rate or average rating as their target, but we do not have that available here.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note there is an updated version of this dataset with more features available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/). The features were are using in `listings.csv.gz` for the New York city datasets. You will also see some other files like `reviews.csv.gz`. For your own interest you may want to explore the expanded dataset and try your analysis there. However, please submit your results on the dataset obtained from Kaggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your tasks:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Spend some time understanding the options and pick the one you find more interesting (it may help spending some time looking at the documentation available on Kaggle for each dataset).\n",
    "2. After making your choice, focus on understanding the problem and what each feature means, again using the documentation on the dataset page on Kaggle. Write a few sentences on your initial thoughts on the problem and the dataset. \n",
    "3. Download the dataset and read it as a pandas dataframe. "

    "I have chosen to use the Default of Credit Card Clients Dataset that contains data on the default payments of credit card clients in Taiwan from 2005. This dataset appears to contain sequential data of client bill totals and payment amounts, so I believe finding the most important features for prediction will be a struggle, as it makes sense to think that sequences of activity are more useful to us when predicting default (such as a customer racking up large credit with little ability to repay) rather than their activity in one particular month. Finding particularly which months of activity or sequences of activity leading up to the default are most indicative of the failure to pay will be a challenging task. "

I also want to get a sense for how representative our accuracy may or may not be of our model's performance when it comes to recognizing the default class.

My reasoning for this is because -1 is encoded to be when the customer pays their balance in full, 0 when they make the minimum payment, and 1-9 being delayed payment for n months where n is between 1-9. It seems counter-intuitive to encode inactivity to be better than paying off a balance. In fact, it doesn't make any sense, and is extracting important insights from the dataset.\n",

In fact, the recall score with feature selection is lower than without, suggesting no improvement with feature selection but worsening of model performance. This makes sense, as, with time series data, data points are only relevant in the context of the other points. This is what I suppose is happening here, where the feature selection process has deselected some features that are part of a time series (and other features depend upon them for context)."

    "Above, we can see that a customer's repayment status from the first month the data started to be recorded, specifically if they were delaying their payments by two months or not, tends to be an important feature in default prediction. The second most important feature is whether or not a customer is paying the minimum balance on their bills in the first month the data was recorded. It seems here that the foot the customer gets started off on in terms of repayment status tends to be a large predictor in whether or not they will eventually default (within a 6 month period). I am surprised that the feaures I engineered turned out not to be so relevant in terms of default prediction and the time series data appears to be best for prediction."

    "To improve the model further I would consider using `KBinsDiscretizer` on the bill and payment amounts to see if this durastically improves my binary classification performance. I may also try less interpretable but more powerful models like `XGBoost` or `CatBoost` for classification to see how they fare in terms of performance on train and test data. "

It was surprising to see how impactful feature engineering can be on a model's performance, as I thought the type of model and the tuning of its hyper-parameters were more important to model performance than the data itself. I knew that data had to be cleaned and wrangled before it was passed to a machine learning model, but what I didn't understand that new features could be made from the features existing in the data set to substantially increase metrics like accuracy and recall; that is my biggest takeway from the supervised machine learning material we have learned so far."
