# CPSC 330: Credit Card Fraud Prediction

This is an assignment for UBC's CPSC 330: Applied Machine Learning course. For this assignment, I:

- Created multiple pipelines, including data preprocessing with Sci-Kit Learnâ€™s ColumnTransformer, across various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN, for binary credit card default classification.
- Performed feature selection using recursive feature elimination and feature engineering and evaluated the effect on the models I experimented with
- Increased model recall by x2 by recognizing class imbalance in the dataset and tuning classifiers to balance classes accordingly to increase sensitivity to the positive class

  The whole project, including self-reflections, can be found under
